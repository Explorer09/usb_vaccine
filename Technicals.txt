It's not just AutoRun, USB malware is more than that.

One of the reasons that USB malware is hard to defeat and so widespread on
Windows systems is that Windows, originated from DOS, do not have proper enough
execution prevention mechanisms. Generally, user should be aware of that he is
_unintentionally_ running an _arbitrary_ program, when he opens a drive or a
file inside it.

Unix/Linux already have execution mode bits, and the (optional) 'noexec' mount
option. They're not perfect, but DO prevent most of the tricks that USB malware
could do on Windows. There's no execute bit on Windows, so we have to let users
aware by other means.

There are several factors that a Windows user might mistakenly runs a program,
thinking he is opening a (legitimate) file:
- File extension displayed in Windows Explorer (_displayed_, which may be fake)
- File icon, whether it is static or dynamic based on file content (malicious
  file can have an icon faking the user that it's something safe)
- Shortcut arrows
- Whether file itself is loaded and executed directly by the OS, executed only
  via an interpreter, or have no execution data at all
(This list is not exhaustive.)

Technically these correspond to the following things:

1. "NeverShowExt" or "AlwaysShowExt" registry value in class key (technically
   known as ProgID) of the file type ("NeverShowExt" takes precedence if both
   values exist)
2. "Hide extension for known file types" checkbox in "Folder Options", which
   corresponds to "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\
   Advanced" value "HideFileExt" in registry
3. The presence of "shellex\IconHandler" registry subkey of class key of the
   file type, and, if not present, the "DefaultIcon" subkey
4. "IsShortcut" registry value in class key of the file type
5. "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Shell Icons" value
   "29" (if present this overrides the shortcut overlay arrow icon provided by
   shell32.dll)
6. Default value of "shell\open\command" subkey of class key of the file type,
   whether it begins with "%1", or ends with "%*", or both

Ideally on a secure system,

1. No "NeverShowExt" value should be present for every file type, so that users
   can see every extension of every file type. ("AlwaysShowExt" would be
   optional if no extensions are hidden at all.)
2. "HideFileExt" should be 0 (false).
3. The file icon may be dynamic only if there's no executable code in the file
   contents, and static otherwise. By "static" here I mean there's no Icon
   Handler, and the "DefaultIcon" is not "%1". That is, all files of the same
   type should display the same icon.
4. "IsShortcut" be present for all file types that represent links to another
   file, especially to file that may be executable.
5. The "Shell Icons" registry value "29" should either not exist or refer to an
   icon that is not blank icon.
6. Files that are not binary self-executable (PE, NE, MZ, or old COM format)
   shouldn't have "%1" in the beginning data of their "shell\open\command"
   default values, and files that are no executable code (script or binary)
   shouldn't have "%*" in end of "shell\open\command" default values.

One exception can be made for scripts that contain shebangs indicating which
interpreter it is meant to be run in, and so will be necessary for OS kernel to
load it and parses the shebang. This is true for perl/python/shell scripts, but
not batch scripts. (And so having the default value of '"%1" %*' in "HKCR\
batfile\shell\open\command" is a bad idea. Should be 'cmd /c "%1" %*'. It might
remain as is for historical reasons. I don't know.)

Below is the list of some common file types and whether they fit the conditions
listed above. To ensure safety, at least 1 of the 6 cells should be marked
"safe" for every file type. The "Extension display" column is considered safe
only if there doesn't exist "NeverShowExt" value for the given file type, and
user disables the "HideFileExt" option (value set to 0), which is NOT the
default.

Notes:
[1] These types are not shortcuts, but executable code, hence the files may
    contain code that executes other programs.
[2] There is no DefaultIcon subkey in "HKCR\scrfile", but "%1" is implied for
    this file type.
[3] .scr is self-executable (NE or PE format), so %* technically doesn't
    matter. Therefore no "safe" is marked on this field.
[4] Although .pif is a shortcut format, it's "open" verb, as handled by Windows
    Explorer, does not check the validity of PIF format properly. It silently
    allows a PE executable in .pif extension to be executed when user "opens"
    it in Explorer. For this reason 'usb_vaccine.cmd' proposes to remove the
    NeverShowExt value for this file type. Strangely enough, an executable of
    COM, MZ or NE format and in .pif extension has the expected behavior of
    not being executed.
[5] .lnk, .url and symbolic links have special Context Menu Handlers that
    change the default (open) verb.
[6] Symbolic links ("symlinks") are a kind of special files in NTFS whose file
    name may be in any or no extension. Since Windows 8.1, Windows Explorer
    associates file symbolic links with the "HKCR\.symlink" registry key.
    Windows 7 SP1 systems will also support the "HKCR\.symlink" association if
    KB3009980 hotfix is installed.
    In Windows 8.1 or later, or in Windows 7 with the hotfix, the display
    behavior of the symlink's name extension is determined by "NeverShowExt" or
    "AlwayShowExt" values in "HKCR\.symlink" key, or, if neither of the values
    exist (which is the default), user's "HideFileExt" option. Therefore
    symlink's name extension is not displayed for a default user's setting.
    (This is a bad thing, since a symlink's name extension becomes irrelevant
    in the new behavior of opening symlink or showing symlink's icons.
    Therefore the extension shall be visible. 'usb_vaccine.cmd' will propose
    this change for you if possible on your system.)
    In Windows Vista, 8 or 7 without the hotfix, the display of a symlink's
    extension is determined by the file type to which the symlink's name
    extension corresponds. For example, a "foo.dll" symlink to "bar.scf" will
    have the ".dll" extension always displayed, because of the default
    "AlwaysShowExt" behavior of the .dll file (the "NeverShowExt" behavior of
    .scf file is ignored).
    A symlink always shows a shortcut arrow overlay in Windows Explorer, even
    though there isn't an "IsShortcut" value in the ".symlink" key. This arrow
    overlay display behavior is the same (since Windows Vista) with or without
    the hotfix.

File types with data "%1" in default values of their "DefaultIcon" subkeys:

Note: The (Win95+) mark in Software field means that the file type exists in
older Windows versions or DOS, but not until Windows 95 was there a file
association entry for it.

In Windows 2000, XP or Vista, the font file types ('.otf', '.ttc', '.ttf',
except '.fon') have "%1" in default values of their respective "DefaultIcon"
subkeys. Font files can never contain an icon, so it is fontext.dll that
provides the icon for those fonts (depending on format, e.g. TrueType or
"OpenType with TrueType outlines", both having '.ttf' file extension).

File types that are self-executable (i.e. their data of "shell\open\command"
default values begin with "%1"):
    batfile, cmdfile, comfile, exefile, piffile, scrfile

For these extensions, the "NeverShowExt" value in their class keys should never

Windows.XPSReachViewer is associated with 6 file extensions (7 extensions in
Windows 8 or later): .dwfx .jtx .xps .easmx .edrwx .eprtx (.oxps)

It is in Windows 8 or later that "Microsoft.System.Update.1\shell\open\command"
default value contains "%*". In Windows Vista, the value is
'"%systemroot%\system32\wusa.exe" "%1" %2 %3 %4'; in Windows 7 the value is
'"%systemroot%\system32\wusa.exe" "%1" %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9'.

.cpl (HKCR\cplfile) contains "%*" in its "shell\cplopen\command" default value.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 'ASSOC' command in Windows NT is simply a registry program reading and
writing default value of "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Classes\<key>", ignoring the
equivalent key in HKCU. There is an unintentional feature: "ASSOC exefile"
works, and shows the name of the file type or ProgID in question.

Similarly, 'FTYPE' command reads and writes the "shell\open\command" subkey for
a given file type. It ignores the default value of "shell" subkey.

As Microsoft does not document the details of these commands, neither of them
are reliable across Windows versions. (Can't ensure they always read HKLM and
never HKCU.) We will just use "reg query" or "reg add" for accurate reading and
writing.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Important notes about file names, long file names (LFN), "short names" (a.k.a.
8.3 file name), and how Windows processes them:

1. Long file names, as stored in NTFS and VFAT LFN entries, are all encoded in
   UCS-2LE (or UTF-16LE in Windows 2000, XP or later).
2. In FAT, short names are encoded in the "character set" as defined by OS's
   current "system locale" (changeable in Windows 2000, XP or later, i.e.
   "Control Panel" -> "Regional Options" -> "Language for non-Unicode programs"
   setting; note that this setting requires reboot and isn't what CHCP command
   could change in shell environment). On a multi-byte encoding, Windows may
   generate short names that contain bytes 0x5C "\" or 0x7C "|". GBK, Big5 and
   Shift_JIS encodings all suffer from this because a code point like 0xE05C
   may be a valid character in them.
3. Short names can be optionally generated in NTFS (it's enabled by default),
   short names in NTFS are encoded in UCS-2LE or UTF-16LE and stored as
   variable-length strings in on-disk format, just like long file names.
4. When reading file names, for non-Unicode programs including cmd.exe, they
   are transparently converted from Unicode to the current "system locale"
   encoding.
   Unmappable characters are converted to question marks "?" (0x3F) on display
   and command output.
5. cmd.exe has limitations and bugs regarding file name processing:
   - If two files can be presented as same name in DIR output (possible when
     name contains characters unmappable in shell's "active code page" (as set
     by 'chcp' command) and become question marks on display), retrieving file
     info via parsing DIR output may retrieve the wrong file.
     Example that won't work:
         FOR /F "delims=" %%I IN ('DIR /B') DO (ECHO "%%~atzfsI" & DIR "%%I")
     But this works:
         FOR %%I IN (*) DO (ECHO "%%~atzfsI" & DIR "%%I")
     Retrieving file name via "file name completion" (tab key, or Ctrl+F and
     Ctrl+D if cmd.exe is invoked with "/f:on") can refer to the correct file
     even though question marks might appear on display.
   - If a file's short name happens to contain a 0x5C "\" byte (for example
     from a 0xE05C character) in a FAT filesystem, and the shell's "active code
     page" doesn't treat a "\" byte as part of a multi-byte character, "%%~psI"
     will contain part of the file name up to and including the last "\" byte,
     while "%%~nsI" will have the aforementioned part of file name cut out.
     Note that this bugs happens only in FAT with short names - Windows never
     leaks out "\" character on interpreting UTF-16LE file names.

Algorithm of generating "short names" from long file names in Windows:

1. First, determine the "base name" and the "extension" from the file name.
   Search for last period "." in the file name, and split the file name string.
   Define "base name" as part of the string before the period, and "extension"
   as part of the string after the period. If the file name contains no period,
   then this file has no extension, and define "base name" as the whole string.
2. If "base name" is empty when determined by the method above (possible with
   file names like ".bashrc"), set "extension" to empty and "base name" to what
   was the "extension", and set "add suffix" flag.
3. Remove all spaces and periods "." from "base name" and "extension". If there
   is any character removed, set "add suffix" flag.
4. Replace each occurrence of following characters with underscores "_":
   + , ; = [ ]
   If any character get replaced this way, set "add suffix" flag.
   (Multi-byte characters are not touched yet, even for those just happening to
   contain any of these bytes.)
5. Convert all lowercase letters in "base name" and "extension" to UPPERCASE.
   The conversion depends on OS, file system and "system locale":
   - FAT in Windows 95, 98 or Me: Windows will also convert uppercased Unicode
     characters to the default code page for the DOS/shell environment (e.g.
     CP437 for en-US locale). If there are characters that can't be converted
     to the target code page, replace them with underscores and set "add
     suffix" flag.
     If no characters have been uppercased or converted, and the file name
     contains no underscore and no character with code point 0x7F or above, an
     LFN entry will not be created for the file (unless "base name" or
     "extension" exceeds the 8.3 length limit, see below).
     (An LFN entry may be created unnecessarily, with the byte-identical name
     if the name just happens to contain underscores and no other special
     characters, e.g. "STI_CI32.DLL".)
     In Turkish locale, both lowercase dotted and dotless i's are converted to
     uppercase dotless I's when generating short names, uppercase dotted I's
     are left as is. (I'm not sure if this behavior is intended.)
   - FAT in Windows NT: Windows will also convert uppercased Unicode characters
     to the default code page for the DOS/shell environment, except that visual
     lookalikes may be used if there's no direct representation (e.g. "small a
     with acute" converted to "A" without acute as CP437 doesn't include
     "capital A with acute" despite including "small a with acute"). If there
     are characters that can't be converted this way, set "add suffix" flag,
     and the characters may be removed or replaced with underscores (the detail
     is locale-specific).
     If the file name contains no character with code point 0x80 or above, the
     "base name" characters are either all UPPERCASE or all lowercase, and so
     are the "extension" characters, an LFN entry will not be created for the
     file (unless "base name" or "extension" exceeds the 8.3 length limit).
     Windows NT logs the letter case of two strings as two flag bits in FAT
     directory entry of the file. The file name will be stored in all UPPERCASE
     on disk after this.
     In Turkish locale, the lowercase dotless i is left as is (not uppercased),
     and so is the uppercase dotted I.
     In Hebrew locale, combining marks are removed because they are not
     included in CP862 (DOS Hebrew code page). If there existed such marks in
     the file name, set "add suffix" flag.
   - NTFS: If "system locale" is not using a multi-byte encoding, Windows
     removes all (Unicode) characters with code point 0x7F or above in the file
     name. If there existed such characters, set "add suffix" flag.
     If "system locale" is using a multi-byte encoding, Windows checks if the
     file name characters can be represented in the target encoding, using the
     same conversion rule as in FAT. If there are characters that can't
     represent in target encoding, set "add suffix" flag, and the characters
     may be removed or replaced with underscores (the detail is locale-
     specific).
     If "add suffix" flag is not set, and "base name" and "extension" fit the
     8.3 length limit, a "short name" entry will not be created for the file.
6. If "add suffix" flag is not set, and, when represented in the current
   "system locale" encoding, the "base name" is at most 8 bytes in length, and
   "extension" at most 3 bytes (the "8.3 length limit"), make this "base name"
   and "extension" the short name of the file. If this name has been used by
   another file (with a long file name), regenerate the short name of that
   file. End.
   Otherwise, remove characters (not bytes) from the right of "base name" and
   "extension", until "base name" is at most 6 bytes and "extension" at most
   3 bytes.
7. In Windows NT only, if "base name" is at most 2 bytes at this point, append
   4 uppercase hexadecimal digits from an undocumented hash of the file name.
8. Let N be 1 and "suffix" be "~1". From now on, "suffix" will be always a
   tilde "~" followed by the number N formatted in decimal digits.
9. (Loop:)
   Construct "name" from "base name", "suffix", a period and "extension".
   If no file in the directory use this "name" as its short name, make this be
   the file's short name. End.
   Otherwise, a collision occurs. Increment N by 1 and go to head of (loop).
   In Windows NT only, if N reaches 4 and "name" still collides at this point,
   and "base name" has not been appended with the hash in step 7, remove
   characters from the right of "base name" to at most 2 bytes, append 4
   uppercase hexadecimal digits from an undocumented hash of the file name,
   reset N to 1, and go to head of (loop). If "base name" has already been
   appended with the hash, continue incrementing N and looping.
   (Side note: Linux vfat driver does not implement the hash, but instead use
   hexadecimal digits generated from "jiffies" and thus the digits are not
   deterministic.)
   If N reaches 9 and "name" still collides, truncate "base name" further to at
   most 5 bytes (note: in Windows NT this can result in one digit of hash being
   removed), set N to 10, and go to head of (loop).
   If N reaches 99 and "name" still collides, truncate "base name" further to
   at most 4 bytes, set N to 100 and continue the loop, and so on, until no
   collision occurs.

Forbidden characters in long file names in Windows:
0x00-0x1F " *       / :   <   > ?   \       |
(41 characters in total)

Forbidden characters in file names in IBM PC DOS / MS-DOS (2.00 and later):
0x00-0x20 " * + , . / : ; < = > ? [ \ ] a-z |
(75 characters in total)

Forbidden characters in file names in IBM PC DOS / MS-DOS (1.x):
0x00-0x20 " * + , . / : ;   =   ? [   ] a-z
(71 characters in total)
Note: \ < > | was allowed in DOS 1.x, before DOS 2 introduces directories and
I/O redirection.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Important notes about commands behaviors:
- MOVE command exits with 1 when a move error occurs. There's no way to specify
  "don't overwrite" option for MOVE command.
- DEL command exits with 1 only when arguments syntax or path is invalid. It's
  exit code does not distinguish between deletion success and failure.
- Both MOVE and DEL refuse to process files with Hidden or System (or both)
  attribute set. (They'll output the "could not find" error.) However since
  Windows NT, DEL supports '/A' option that can workaround this.
- 'attrib' utility without '/L' option follows symlinks when reading or
  changing attributes. '/L' is not available before Windows Vista.
- The %~a1 method will retrieve attributes of the link itself, if the file
  referenced by %1 is a link (junction or symlink).
- If "dirlink" is a directory link (attributes "DL"), "DEL dirlink" deletes all
  files in the target directory (DANGEROUS), while "RMDIR dirlink" (with or
  without '/S') removes the symlink without touching anything in the target
  directory (SAFE). MOVE command on links always processes links themselves
  rather than link targets.

List of various shortcut types in Windows and their properties regarding
security.

The shortcut types that 'usb_vaccine.cmd' is currently concerned about are:
.pif, .lnk, .shb, .url, .appref-ms, and .glk

We don't try to fix every shortcut type, but only types that may bring
vulnerabilities to the user's system.

 Shortcut | Format |  May point to  | Custom | Show  | Handles | Proper-
   type   |        |   executable   |  icon  | ext.  | default |  ties
          |        |                |        |       |  verb   |  tab
----------+--------+----------------+--------+-------+---------+--------

.ccr        Binary   No               No       User    No        No
(This list is in no particular order.)

Fields meanings:
- May point to executable: Whether the shortcut format allows the target to be
  an executable file and whether it will be executed when user opens the
  shortcut. "Not executed" means the file format allows pointing to executable,
  but the handler program will filter out the file type of the target and so
  it's not executed.
- Custom icon: Whether the file type is associated with a custom IconHandler.
- Show ext.: Whether the file extension will be shown for the file type.
  "Never" means a "NeverShowExt" value is present for the type. "User" means
  the extension is shown according to user's "HideFileExt" option. "N/A" means
  technically the shortcut type can have any or no extension.
- Handles default verb: "Yes" means the type is associated with a
  ContextMenuHandler which may change the default (open) verb for the file. In
  other words, the "shell\open\command" subkey is not reliable to determine the
  default action for that type.
  (<https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ee453696(v=vs.85).aspx>)
- Properties tab: Whether the file type is assigned a custom tab in the
  Properties window.

Notes:
[1] Custom icon for .pif is no longer shown in Windows Vista or later.
    (Reported by some users on the Internet. I couldn't find an official
    document noting this change. This is nothing to do with MS10-046 lnk file
    vulnerability.)
[2] The default "open" verb for .pif is handled by Windows Explorer.
[3] Office Groove 2007 launches the URL directly when user opens the shortcut.
    SharePoint Workspace 2010 instead pops up a warning before launching.
    However it's a bad idea to allow pointing to .exe in the first place.
[4] .appref-ms may point to remote application only (to a .manifest file).
    However it may still trick users into opening and downloading the app.
[5] Windows Explorer associates Folder Shortcuts with the
    "HKCR\CLSID\{0AFACED1-E828-11D1-9187-B532F1E9575D}" registry key, in which
    there is "shellex\IconHandler" subkey and value.
[6] Symbolic links ("symlinks") are a kind of special files in NTFS whose file
    name may be in any or no extension. Since Windows 8.1, Windows Explorer
    associates file symbolic links with the "HKCR\.symlink" registry key.
    Windows 7 SP1 systems will also support the "HKCR\.symlink" association if
    KB3009980 hotfix is installed.
    In Windows 8.1 or later, or in Windows 7 with the hotfix, the symlink type
    has an IconHandler that displays the icon of the file the link points to.
    (Unlike .lnk file, a symlink doesn't allow specification of a custom icon.)
    The display behavior of the symlink's name extension is determined by
    "NeverShowExt" or "AlwayShowExt" values in "HKCR\.symlink" key, or, if
    neither of the values exist (which is the default), user's "HideFileExt"
    option (which is to hide by default).
    The symlink type has a ContextMenuHandler that sets the default verb of the
    symlink, similar to .lnk file. However, for a symlink pointing to a .lnk
    file, no verbs will be assigned for the symlink (and the symlink will show
    a generic file icon). It won't resolve .lnk target from a symbolic link
    pointing to a .lnk file.
    In Windows Vista, 8 or 7 without the hotfix, a symlink's icon, context
    menu, default verb and the display of the symlink's name extension are all
    determined by the file type that the symlink's name extension corresponds
    to, except that a symlink always shows a shortcut arrow overlay despite the
    symlink's name extension. The file type or name extension of the symlink's
    target is not considered. Windows Explorer may resolve a .lnk target from a
    symlink if the symlink's name is in ".lnk" extension.
[7] It's possible to have a .shs file renamed to .shb. (The Shell Scrap handler
    doesn't check whether the file extension matches the format.) .shs files
    allow embedding executable code (as OLE objects).

Technical notes about users, user profiles and user registry hives in NT-based
Windows versions.

Windows DOES NOT load the registry settings (hives) of all users to the main
tree (specifically, under HKEY_USERS). Rather, only hives of the users that are
currently logged on will be loaded, as well as registry of service users.
(The "service user accounts" in Windows have similar functions as "system
users" in Unix and other operating systems.) There are 3 service users
available by default in Windows at this time:

SID       Name                                Available since
S-1-5-18  LocalSystem    ("SYSTEM")           WinNT3
S-1-5-19  LocalService   ("LOCAL SERVICE")    WinXP
S-1-5-20  NetworkService ("NETWORK SERVICE")  WinXP

See this for general information about these 3 service users:
<https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms686005(v=vs.85).aspx>

All NT-based Windows versions store the list of all user profiles in
"HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\ProfileList", with users'
SIDs as subkey names. (Windows might create profile backups with key names like
"<SID>.bak" inside "ProfileList", in case that some profiles fail to logon).
For ease of documenting, we will refer to this key as the "ProfileList" key.

Forbidden characters in usernames of all NT-based Windows versions:
0x00-0x1F " * + , / : ; < = > ? [ \ ] |
(47 characters in total)

For NT-based Windows versions, the list of currently loaded hives and the file
locations of them may be seen in
"HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\hivelist".

The locations where users' profiles and registry hives are stored differ among
Windows versions. In Windows terminology, a "user profile" consists of user
registry hives and, in Windows NT 4 or later, a set of profile folders.

Below are differences in user profiles management per Windows version.

In Windows 3.x:

There is no multi-user support at all. No user profiles or user registry.

In Windows 95, 98 and Me:

If multi-user is not enabled (which is the default), the user registry will be
"%WinDir%\USER.DAT" and loaded as "HKEY_USERS" registry key. If multi-user is
enabled, each user will have a profile folder and registry hive
"%WinDir%\Profiles\<username>\USER.DAT" (loaded as "HKU\<username>" key) as
well as local system's USER.DAT.

In addition, the list of all user profiles will be provided in
"HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\ProfileList", with <username>
as subkeys. (Note: Multi-user in Windows 9x was not meant to be a security
mechanism. There's no access control in the file system level. What it does is
only separating user profiles, documents and folders.)

In Windows NT 3.x:

The "user profile" is only a registry hive. The user hives are all in
"%SystemRoot%\system32\config", with file naming like this: "first 5 characters
of username (including spaces)" + "3 lowercase hexadecimal digits" + "(no
extension)" Example: "J. Ra000" for username "J. Random Hacker".

The hive of local system user ("SYSTEM") is "%WinDir%\system32\config\default"
and loaded as "HKU\.DEFAULT". The hive template for creating new users is
"%WinDir%\system32\config\UserDef".

Registry values "ProfileImagePath" in "ProfileList\<SID>" store paths to the
hive files of the respective users (not the directories).

User's "Home folder" (a.k.a. home directory, which is distinct from "profile")
is optional and may be specified as any local path, or a network share folder
with a drive letter to "map" at login time. If the path is not specified when
creating a new user, it defaults to "C:\users\default", a common directory that
is writable by everyone (assuming your system drive is C:).

Roaming user profiles and mandatory user profiles are distinguished from local
user profiles by file extensions (.usr for roaming and .man for mandatory).

(We cannot test if Windows NT 3.x supports the "CentralProfile" registry value
(see below) or how mandatory profiles are created or managed.)

In Windows NT 4.0:

The "user profile" consist of also profile directories in Windows NT 4 or
later. The profiles directories are by default
"%SystemRoot%\Profiles\<username>". (Also, %USERPROFILE% environment variable
starts to exist and refers to the directory.) User's registry hive is
"NTUSER.DAT" in %USERPROFILE%.

The hive of local system user ("SYSTEM") is still
"%WinDir%\system32\config\default". The template profile directory for new
users is "%WinDir%\Profiles\Default User". The hive template for creating users
is NTUSER.DAT in Default User directory. "%WinDir%\Profiles\All Users" exists
and stores files shared for all users.

Registry values "ProfileImagePath" in "ProfileList\<SID>" store paths to the
profile directories, a.k.a. %USERPROFILE% for the respective users. (Local
users with their "ProfileImagePath" pointing to a hive file will, upon login,
have a profile directory created and the hive moved in there.)

User's "Home folder" is still distinct from "profile folder" and the home
folder defaults to "C:\" if not specified.

For a roaming or mandatory profile, the "CentralProfile" registry value (with
type REG_SZ) stores the path of the folder (usually a network share folder, but
a local one also works) the roaming profile is copied from and also the folder
that it will sync to when logging off. Mandatory profiles are distinguished
from roaming ones by the existence of the hive file "NTUSER.MAN" (instead of
NTUSER.DAT) in the profile directories. For local user profile, the
"CentralProfile" value exists but its data is an empty string.

In Windows 2000:

Profiles directories are by default in "%SystemDrive%\Documents and Settings".

For every user except the local system user, in addition to hive NTUSER.DAT,
user will have its registry entries under "Software\Classes" subkey stored in a
separate hive, named:
"%USERPROFILE%\Local Settings\Application Data\Microsoft\Windows\UsrClass.dat"
UsrClass.dat files are loaded as "HKU\<SID>_Classes" key upon logon, and
"HKU\<SID>\Software\Classes" (and the respective Classes key in HKCU) will be
a link to "HKU\<SID>_Classes".

"Default User" (the template) and "All Users" (the shared files) still exist,
but their profile directories are moved to "Documents and Settings".

Registry values "AllUserProfile", "DefaultUserProfile" and "ProfileDirectory"
exist in the "ProfileList" key.

Value name            Type           Default data
"AllUserProfile"      REG_SZ         "All Users"
"DefaultUserProfile"  REG_SZ         "Default User"
"ProfileDirectory"    REG_EXPAND_SZ  "%SystemDrive%\Documents and Settings"

In "ProfileList\<SID>" key, "RefCount" value starts to exist and denotes the
number of active sessions for that user. ('usb_vaccine.cmd' will ensure this
value's data be 0 before attempting to load and edit the user's hives.)

User's "Home folder" still defaults to "C:\".

Windows 2000, XP and later separate "local" data (files) from roaming data in a
profile. Local files are not synchronized with what's in the central profile
folder when the profile is logged off. Registry value "ExcludeProfileDirs" in
key "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon" determines
which sub-directories should not be synchronized upon logoff. The UsrClass.dat
mentioned above is local by default, but my be changed according to KB298960.

In Windows XP:

Two service accounts, "LocalService" and "NetworkService", are available in
addition to local system user since Windows XP. Their profile directories are
in "Documents and Settings" in Windows XP (by default; they may be changeable).
Local system user also has a profile directory, as
"%systemroot%\system32\config\systemprofile", except that registry hive is
still "%WinDir%\system32\config\default" and so there is no NTUSER.DAT for the
system profile.

SIDs and profile information of all three service accounts are available as
subkeys in the "ProfileList" key.
"HKU\S-1-5-18" key exists and links to "HKU\.DEFAULT".

User's "Home folder" defaults to %USERPROFILE%.

Windows XP is the last version that supports roaming profiles of a Windows NT
3.x format.

In Windows Vista or later:

Major changes are done in file system layout and user profiles management in
Windows Vista. Old directory layout and names are created as NTFS junction
points for backward compatibility. For brevity, directory names and junctions
for backward compatibility are omitted in this document.

Profiles directories are now by default in "%SystemDrive%\Users".

UsrClass.dat for each user is now in
"%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows"

"ProgramData" and "Public" directories replace "All Users" directory.
("C:\Users\All Users" becomes a symlink to "C:\ProgramData". Sub-directories
previously available in "All Users" are created as junctions in "ProgramData"
for backward compatibility, some of which point to respective sub-directories
in "Public".) Note that the layout of "Public" and "All Users" are different.
Folder names like "Shared Documents" are renamed to "Public Documents" in
abstract level.

Profile directories of LocalService and NetworkService are in
"%WinDir%\ServiceProfiles". Registry hive for local system user is
"%WinDir%\System32\config\DEFAULT" (letter casing change only).

("%WinDir%\System32\config\systemprofile\ntuser.dat" exists in Windows Vista,
7, 8 and 8.1. We haven't figured out the purpose of this hive file yet. This
file does not appear in Windows 10.)

In the "ProfileList" key, values "AllUserProfile" and "DefaultUserProfile" are
no longer available. They are replaced with "Default", "ProgramData" and
"Public" values for managing directories of Default User (template profile),
Program Data, and Public respectively. (NOTICE: This is a backward-incompatible
registry change!)

Value name            Type           Default data
"Default"             REG_EXPAND_SZ  "%SystemDrive%\Users\Default"
"ProfileDirectory"    REG_EXPAND_SZ  "%SystemDrive%\Users"
"ProgramData"         REG_EXPAND_SZ  "%SystemDrive%\ProgramData"
"Public"              REG_EXPAND_SZ  "%SystemDrive%\Users\Public"

Windows Vista cannot roam a user profile of Windows XP format or vice versa.
The profile formats are backward incompatible!
Roaming user profile in Windows Vista and 7 is known as "version 2" profile -
the central profile _folder_ (the one on a network share) requires a ".v2" name
suffix to distinguish from Windows 2000 / XP profiles on the network. (The
suffix isn't needed when all computers on the network use Vista or later.)

Windows Vista and later also supports "super mandatory profile", a kind of
mandatory profile with an addition that when the central profile folder cannot
be loaded, the system denies the log on instead of creating a temporary profile
for the user. Super mandatory profiles are distinguished from (normal)
mandatory profiles by the ".man" or ".man.v2" suffix on the central profile
_folder_ (the hive file should also be named "NTUSER.MAN" inside).

BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLITY WARNING: Windows 8 and 8.1 both introduced some
undocumented changes on the user profiles that makes them incompatible with
older versions of Windows, and yet they continue to use the ".v2" folder name
suffix. PROFILE CORRUPTION IS POSSIBLE if user uses a Windows 8 or 8.1 system
to logon a roaming profile created in Windows Vista / 7, or vice versa.
This error is addressed in KB2887239 (Windows 8) and KB2890783 (Windows 8.1).
(NOTE: The version suffix change is disabled by default after the hotfix is
installed. You need to manually set up a registry value to enable it. Blame
Microsoft for not caring for compatibility problem earlier!)
Windows 10 enables the ".v5" suffix by default and so no longer has the
problem. (See KB3056198)

Technical details about folders' "Web View", Desktop.ini and Folder.htt.

The "Web View" of the folders, Folder.htt, and extensions for Desktop.ini were
all introduced in Windows Desktop Update, which was a feature of IE4. (The
Desktop.ini itself was in Windows 95 earlier than Windows Desktop Update.)
Windows Desktop Update was optional for Windows 95 and NT4, but is a mandatory
feature in Windows 98 or later.

The program of the "Customize This Folder Wizard" was "ieshwiz.exe" located in
"%WinDir%\System" (for 95, 98 or Me) or "%WinDir%\System32" (for NT4 or 2000).

In 95, NT4 or 98, when user chooses to "Create or edit an HTML document",
ieshwiz.exe copys the "%webdir%\folder.htt" file to the folder to be
customized, and shows an edit screen (Notepad) of the new Folder.htt to user.

(The %webdir% refers to "C:\Windows\Web" directory, if it's not explicitly
configured otherwise. The variable does appear in registry entries.)

Windows 2000 and Me included an updated version of ieshwiz.exe that allows user
to choose one of four templates, and optionally edit it:
- Standard              ("standard.htt")
- Classic (icons only)  ("classic.htt")
- Simple                ("starter.htt")
- Image Preview         ("ImgView.htt")

If user selects ImgView.htt and doesn't select "I want to edit this template"
checkbox, ieshwiz.exe will not copy the template. Otherwise, it copies the
selected template to a new subfolder named "Folder Settings" (with Hidden and
System attributes) inside the folder to be customized (hence, "Folder Settings\
Folder.htt").

Note that standard.htt in the choice above is not the same as folder.htt.
"folder.htt" in Windows 2000 or Me was used only for uncustomized folders.

Windows XP supported Web View before SP1, but no longer included ieshwiz.exe
and .htt file was not used unless in special places (such as Desktop).
The left "Tasks" pane (note: there's no official name for this) in Windows XP
is not implemented as a .htt file. The pane is not used when a folder has a
customized Web View (either done in previous Windows version or coded by hand).
The "Customize This Folder" in Windows XP or later is a property tab instead.
(Details are documented here: <https://support.microsoft.com/kb/812003>)

Windows 2000 SP3 and later, and XP SP1 and later have Web View disabled by
default (<https://support.microsoft.com/kb/819028>). However Desktop.ini may
still be used there to specify a custom icon or background for a folder.

(Note: Folder icon specified in Desktop.ini never works for root folders.
Windows determines drive icons based on the autorun.inf file, or, if it's not
present, the "DriveIcons" key in the local system's registry.)

The "Web View" thing has many names in the "Folder Options" throughout Windows
versions:
95, NT4 or 98: "as Web Page" (in View menu) and "View Web content in folders";
2000 or Me: "Web View" group box -> "Enable Web content in folders";
XP: "Tasks" group box -> "Show common tasks in folders" (which also enables Web
    View).
Microsoft documentation refers to this feature as "Web view".

An unofficial documentation of Desktop.ini can be found here:
<http://hwiegman.home.xs4all.nl/desktopini.html>

The minimum content in Desktop.ini to enable a custom Web View template was:

    [ExtShellFolderViews]
    ; (Optional:) Default={5984FFE0-28D4-11CF-AE66-08002B2E1262}
    {5984FFE0-28D4-11CF-AE66-08002B2E1262}={5984FFE0-28D4-11CF-AE66-08002B2E1262}
    ; (Optional:)
    ; {8BEBB290-52D0-11d0-B7F4-00C04FD706EC}={8BEBB290-52D0-11d0-B7F4-00C04FD706EC}
    [{5984FFE0-28D4-11CF-AE66-08002B2E1262}]
    PersistMoniker=file://Folder.htt
    ; (Or:) PersistMoniker=file://Folder Settings\Folder.htt
    ; (Or:) WebViewTemplate.NT5=<Path to .htt file ("file://" is optional)>
    ; (Optional:) PersistMonikerPreview=<Path to .bmp file (without "file://")>
    [.ShellClassInfo]
    ; (Not technically necessary but ieshwiz.exe adds it anyway:)
    ConfirmFileOp=0

The "Default" value in [ExtShellFolderViews] section specified the default view
of the folder. It was usually omitted and specifying "Default={5984FFE0..." was
redundant. However it may be specified as
"Default={8BEBB290-52D0-11d0-B7F4-00C04FD706EC}", which forced Thumbnails view
by default. (Example: "My Pictures" folder in Windows 2000 or Me)

The "WebViewTemplate.NT5" value was meant for folder templates that worked only
in Windows 2000 or Me. The value was used in Windows 2000 and Me system folders
(specifically, "%ProgramFiles%", "%WinDir%", and "%WinDir%\System32" in 2000 or
"%WinDir%\System" in Me), and is also used in folders with "ImgView.htt" or
similar templates (including "My Pictures" folder). ieshwiz.exe will set the
"WebViewTemplate.NT5" value instead of "PersistMoniker" if "ImgView.htt" is
specified as the folder template.

Below were some important registry entries of default folder templates.

    ; This key existed only in Windows Me. It was for root folder of the system
    ; drive. This template hides all files from view and displays a
    ; "View the entire contents of this drive" link on the left pane.
    [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\SysRootFolder\shellex\ExtShellFolderViews\{5984FFE0-28D4-11CF-AE66-08002B2E1262}]
    "PersistMoniker"="file://%webdir%\\sysroot.htt"

The "default.htt" and "folder.htt" in %webdir% were not identical templates.
"folder.htt" was used for regular directories (note the confusing wording of
"folder" and "directory" in registry entries above), while "default.htt" was
used for special folders such as:
- Dial-Up Networking
- My Briefcase
- Temporary Internet Files
- Downloaded Program Files
- History
- Subscriptions
Read the source code of default.htt for details of when it was used.

The root folder of Windows Me system drive did NOT contain Desktop.ini, yet the
folder was displayed with the custom "Web View" template "sysroot.htt". I'm not
sure how this behavior was implemented yet. "Customize This Folder" was still
allowed for root folders of non-system drives in Windows Me.

It is generally still unwise today to delete Desktop.ini files you found in
every directory. Many system directories still use Desktop.ini to denote their
special status (with a "CLSID" value). Some examples include: "Recycle Bin",
"Fonts" and "History".
